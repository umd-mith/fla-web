summary: 'Marie-Henri Beyle (French: [bɛl]; 23 January 1783 – 23 March 1842), better
  known by his pen name Stendhal (French: [stɛ̃dal] or [stɑ̃dal]; in English [ˈstɒ̃dɑːl],
  /stɛnˈdɑːl/, or /stænˈdɑːl/), was a 19th-century French writer. Known for his acute
  analysis of his characters'' psychology, he is considered one of the earliest and
  foremost practitioners of realism, as is evident in the novels Le Rouge et le Noir
  (The Red and the Black, 1830) and La Chartreuse de Parme (The Charterhouse of Parma,
  1839).'
