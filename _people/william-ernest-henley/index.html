summary: William Ernest Henley (23 August 1849 – 11 July 1903) was an influentual
  poet, critic and editor of the late-Victorian era in England that is spoken of as
  having as central a role in his time as Samuel Johnson in the eighteenth century.
  Remembered most often for his 1875 poem "Invictus," a piece which recurs in popular
  awareness (e.g., see the 2009 Clint Eastwood film, Invictus), it is one of his hospital
  poems from early battles with tuberculosis and is said to have developed the artistic
  motif of poet as a patient, and to have anticipated modern poetry in form and subject
  matter. Moreover, as an editor of a series of literary magazines and journals—with
  right to choose contributors, and to offer his own essays, criticism, and poetic
  works—Henley, like Johnson, is said to have had significant influence on culture
  and literary perspectives in the late-Victorian period.
