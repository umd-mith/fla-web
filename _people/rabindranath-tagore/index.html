summary: "Rabindranath Tagore (/rəˈbindrəˈnɑːt ˈtɑːɡɔr/; Bengali pronunciation: [robind̪ro
  nat̪ʰ ʈʰakur]), also written Rabīndranātha Thākura (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941),
  sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music,
  as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th
  centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful
  verse\", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in
  1913. In translation his poetry was viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however,
  his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal.
  Tagore introduced new prose and verse forms and the use of colloquial language into
  Bengali literature, thereby freeing it from traditional models based on classical
  Sanskrit. He was highly influential in introducing the best of Indian culture to
  the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative
  artist of the modern Indian subcontinent.\nA Pirali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral
  gentry roots in Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At age sixteen,
  he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha (\"Sun Lion\"),
  which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he
  graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name.
  As a humanist, universalist internationalist, and strident nationalist he denounced
  the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal
  Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles,
  hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy endures also in the institution
  he founded, Visva-Bharati University.\nTagore modernised Bengali art by spurning
  rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories,
  songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali
  (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are
  his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or
  panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.
  His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's Jana Gana
  Mana and Bangladesh's Amar Shonar Bangla. The lyrics and music for the original
  song of Sri Lanka's National Anthem were also the work of Tagore.\n^ \"Tagore, Sir
