summary: Sir Arnold Edward Trevor Bax, KCVO (8 November 1883 – 3 October 1953) was an English composer and poet. His musical style blended elements of romanticism and impressionism, often with influences from Irish literature and landscape. His orchestral scores are noted for their complexity and colourful instrumentation.  Bax's poetry and stories, which he wrote under the pseudonym of Dermot O’Byrne, reflect his profound affinity for Irish poet W. B. Yeats and are largely written in the tradition of the Irish Literary Revival.
