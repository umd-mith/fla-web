summary: "Lionel Pigot Johnson (15 March 1867 – 4 October 1902) was an English poet,
  essayist and critic. He was born at Broadstairs, and educated at Winchester College
  and New College, Oxford, graduating in 1890. He became a Catholic convert in 1891.
  He lived a solitary life in London, struggling with alcoholism and his repressed
  homosexuality. He died of a stroke after a fall in the street, though it was said
  to be a fall from a barstool in the Green Dragon in Fleet Street.\nDuring his lifetime
  were published his The Art of Thomas Hardy (1894), Poems (1895), Ireland and Other
  Poems (1897). He was one of the Rhymers' Club, and cousin to Olivia Shakespear (who
  dedicated her novel The False Laurel to him).\nIn June 1891, Johnson converted to
  Catholicism, at the same time as he introduced his cousin Lord Alfred Douglas to
  his friend Oscar Wilde, whom he then repudiated, directing a sonnet at him called
  \"The Destroyer of a Soul\" (1892). In 1893, Johnson wrote what some consider his
  masterpiece, \"The Dark Angel\".\n\"The Dark Angel\" also served as one of the influences
  for the Dark Angels chapter of Space Marines in the Warhammer 40,000 fictional universe.
  Their Primarch, Lion El'Jonson, is also named after the poet.\n^  \"Lionel Pigot
