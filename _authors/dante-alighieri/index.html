summary: "Durante degli Alighieri (Italian: [duˈrante ˈdeʎʎi aliˈɡjɛːri]), simply
  called Dante (Italian: [ˈdante], UK /ˈdænti/, US /ˈdɑːnteɪ/; c. 1265–1321), was
  a major Italian poet of the late Middle Ages. His Divine Comedy, originally called
  Comedìa (modern Italian: Commedia) and later called Divina by Boccaccio, is widely
  considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece
  of world literature.\nIn Italy he is called il Sommo Poeta (\"the Supreme Poet\")
  and il Poeta. He, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called \"the three fountains\"
  and \"the three crowns\". Dante is also called \"the Father of the Italian language\".\n^
