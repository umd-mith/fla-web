summary: "Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (/ˈzoʊlə/; French: [e.mil zɔ.la]; 2 April
  1840 – 29 September 1902) was a French writer, the most well-known practitioner
  of the literary school of naturalism and an important contributor to the development
  of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization
  of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer
  Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline J'accuse.
  Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and
  1902."
