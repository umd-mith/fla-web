summary: 'Yevgeny Ivanovich Zamyatin (Russian: Евге́ний Ива́нович Замя́тин; IPA: [jɪvˈɡʲenʲɪj
  ɪˈvanəvʲɪtɕ zɐˈmʲætʲɪn]; January 20 (Julian) / February 1 (Gregorian), 1884 – March
  10, 1937) was a Russian author of science fiction and political satire. He is most
  famous for his 1921 novel We, a story set in a dystopian future police state. Despite
  having been a prominent Old Bolshevik, Zamyatin was deeply disturbed by the policies
  pursued by the CPSU following the October Revolution. In 1921, We became the first
  work banned by the Soviet censorship board. Ultimately, Zamyatin arranged for We
  to be smuggled to the West for publication. The subsequent outrage this sparked
  within the Party and the Union of Soviet Writers led directly to Zamyatin''s successful
  request for exile from his homeland. Due to his use of literature to criticize Soviet
  society, Zamyatin has been referred to as one of the first Soviet dissidents.'
