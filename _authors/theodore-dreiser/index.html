summary: Theodore Herman Albert Dreiser (/ˈdraɪsər, -zər/; August 27, 1871 – December
  28, 1945) was an American novelist and journalist of the naturalist school. His
  novels often featured main characters who succeeded at their objectives despite
  a lack of a firm moral code, and literary situations that more closely resemble
  studies of nature than tales of choice and agency. Dreiser's best known novels include
  Sister Carrie (1900) and An American Tragedy (1925).
