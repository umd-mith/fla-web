summary: Paul Thomas Mann ([paʊ̯l toːmas man]; 6 June 1875 – 12 August 1955) was a
  German novelist, short story writer, social critic, philanthropist, essayist, and
  the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate. His highly symbolic and ironic epic
  novels and novellas are noted for their insight into the psychology of the artist
  and the intellectual. His analysis and critique of the European and German soul
  used modernized German and Biblical stories, as well as the ideas of Goethe, Nietzsche
  and Schopenhauer. Mann was a member of the Hanseatic Mann family and portrayed his
  family and class in the novel Buddenbrooks. His older brother was the radical writer
  Heinrich Mann and three of his six children, Erika Mann, Klaus Mann and Golo Mann,
  also became important German writers. When Hitler came to power in 1933, Mann fled
  to Switzerland. When World War II broke out in 1939, he moved to the United States,
  returning to Switzerland in 1952. Thomas Mann is one of the best-known exponents
  of the so-called Exilliteratur.
