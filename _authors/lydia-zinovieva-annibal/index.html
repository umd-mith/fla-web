  Lydia Dmitrievna Zinovieva-Annibal (Russian: Лидия Дмитриевна Зиновьева-Аннибал) (1866–1907) was a Russian prose writer and dramatist.
  Zinovieva-Annibal was associated with the Silver Age of Russian Poetry. She hosted a literary salon, 'The Tower', with her husband, the poet Viacheslav Ivanov. Her short novel Tridsat'-tri uroda (Thirty-Three Abominations) was one of the few works of its day to openly discuss lesbianism.
