    <p>Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) is a digital archival project devoted to the recovery, reception, and understanding the significance of non-U.S. American authored literary works, as well as immigrant authored literary works, in the U.S. throughout U.S. history. Our principal mission is to draw attention to and challenge conceptions of U.S. American literature that are articulated in terms of an opposition to “foreign” literatures. In particular, we challenge constructions of U.S. American literature that turn on the U.S. citizenship of the author.</p>

    <p>We seek to illuminate and explore how, throughout U.S. history as well as vitally in the present, internationally authored literary works, as well as works by many immigrant authors who wrote in many languages and were not citizens of the United States, have long profoundly constituted an important and irreducible part of the literatures and the cultures of the United States.</p>

    <p>We argue that conceiving (U.S.) American literature, which is to say the literature of the United States and that has meant the most in the United States, in terms that exclude the international and otherwise non-native literary texts that have always been printed and circulated and read in the United States, thereby playing an integral role in constituting the U.S. and its cultures and their relations to the rest of the world, is a conceptual mistake, particularly inapposite to the challenges of the twenty-first century.</p>

    <p>The FLA project thus works with complementary literary approaches and strategies to offer fresh opportunities to globalize the terms through which we understand U.S. literature and culture, both of these domains rediscovered as richly constituted and interpenetrated by global texts, concerns, contexts, voices. FLA pursues these goals by offering various means of studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.</p>
